# Sentry
### A layered detection network reconnaissance detection agent. 

Sentry is a layered detection agent, that sits on the network interface and identifies port scanning behaviour in real time. 

``` 
Port Scanning is a form of techinque used to probe a device or network to determine which ports are closed, open or filtered. Malicious attackers use this technique as a form of reconnaissance, checking for doors are open that they may be able to exploit. 
```

Sentry, as a triage agent, can detect if any reconnaisaance activity or port scanning behaviour, using LLMs and other tools like Zeek, Suricata and libpcap. 
(Note: this agent is not a live product as of yet.)

### Why an LLM? 
Traditional IDS solutions excel at detecting known attack signatures but often struggle to explain alerts, correlate evidence across multiple sources, or prioritize analyst attention. Sentry uses a local LLM only after deterministic detection has narrowed the search space. Rather than replacing traditional security tooling, the model synthesizes evidence from Zeek, Suricata, IP reputation feeds, and a CVE knowledge base into a concise incident assessment, reducing analyst effort while keeping inference costs low.
   
**(1) Traffic Capture - libpcap** 

It captures the raw data of the packet - source and destination IP addresses and ports, payload, protocol, flags, timestamps, etc. 
This creates the foundation for which the tools will work on. 

**(2) Traffic History/Logs - Zeek** 

Parses packets into structured connection logs: who connected to what, when, how, and for how long. Provides behavioural context, pattern detection across connections, slow scan detection, and distributed scan detection — particularly useful when Suricata does not flag a scan due to larger timing gaps.

**(3) Signature Detection - Suricata** 

Port scanners usually operate with the help of scan patterns, like SYN, FIN, NULL, XMAS, UDP scans. Suricata helps in matching the traffic against 50,000+ community rules from the Emerging Threats Open ruleset.

**(4) Triage Agent - ollama + ip reputation lookup** 

The triage agent correlates evidence from four independent sources to produce a structured security assessment.
Combines four pillars to produce a verdict:
- Zeek connection pattern analysis
- Suricata signature match results
- IP reputation (AbuseIPDB + Shodan
  InternetDB, locally cached)
- CVE RAG pipeline: embeddings of a port-confirmed CVE database queried against the detected event, with an LLM producing a structured verdict (intent, severity, recommended action)
False positive filtering, scan type classification, and attacker profiling happen at this layer. Expensive LLM calls are gated behind local filtering so the majority of decisions are handled for free.

**(5) Result - Incident Report** 

Structured output per detected scan: source IP, ports probed, scan type, IP reputation, matched CVEs, attacker intent, severity, and recommended action.

The full stack is designed to be cost-efficient, with expensive model calls gated behind local filtering that handles the majority of decisions for free.

## Output - Example: 
```
Detected 1 scan pattern(s) (threshold: 10+ distinct ports).

Suricata alerts: 0 (none — no signature matches).

Scan detected: 192.168.100.103 -> 192.168.100.102
  Ports probed: 1000
  Type: SYN scan (no response)
  Duration: 21.106s
192.168.100.103
  Representative port: 21
  CVEs in VECTOR_DB for this port: 8
  Raw LLM:   INTENT: Attempt to access the FTP server on port 21.

SEVERITY: High
 ACTION: Escalate
 REASONING: This is a high-severity alert because the attack involves accessing a widely used and critical application (FTP) without authentication, which can lead to data theft or disruption of services. The use of a SYN scan and no response from the server indicates that the connection attempt will likely be successful, making it essential to escalate this incident to increase awareness and take preventive measures.
  Verdict:   High - Escalate
  Intent:    Attempt to access the FTP server on port 21.

## Tech Stack 
- Python - triage pipeline, embedding, and retrieval
- Zeek  - connection log generation
- Suricata - signature detection
- libpcap - packet capture
- Ollama - local LLM inference (bge-base-en-v1.5 for embeddings, Llama-3.2-1B for verdict generation)
- SQLite - CVE database + embedding store + IP reputation cache
- AbuseIPDB + Shodan InternetDB - IP reputation feeds

## Future Enhancements 
- [ ] Add another layer for the LLM to take care of ~1% of the cases that will not be flagged by the 4 pillars. 
- [ ] Live Monitoring - step away from the test conn.log and eve.json
